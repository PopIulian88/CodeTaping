# CodeTaping

This is a cookie clicker kind of game, where you "Code".
Pressing the keyboard, you generate points, and get better and better at coding. 
As you get better, you go for harder programing languages, and slower to write

As you earn points, you can buy keyboards, to help you code faster.

This project idea comes from me and my partner Iulian Poenaru.

We had to do a project for college in Kodular and we decided to try do it in React Native as well
